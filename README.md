Elizar and Manuel's Top 10 Favorite Website's

So for this team project I partnered up with Elizar. For this project we were asked to create a website about our top ten websites. For example, I did my top 10 best movies and my partner did his top ten on video games. We created our website using html, css, and bootstrap. I would like to say we did a pretty good job of making this with only two weeks of learning html, but that goes for the whole class. Everybody's design is really good which is pretty cool because that means we must have a really good teacher and TAâ€™s to ask for help when needed
