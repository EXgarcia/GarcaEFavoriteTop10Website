    <p class="Intro"> Welcome to my Top 10 page. Down below are my favorite games/series of all time that
      I played on Playstation. <br> I based these chart off of Nostalgia, Amount of hours put into the game, incentives,
      skill level, and in game customization. Not all games hit each subject but they hit enough of one or more to make
      it on my Top 10 list.

        <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-xl-6"><big> Review: </big><br> Star Wars Episode 1 Jedi Power Battles is hands down one of the most underrated games of the ps1 era.
              You start off with a handful of Jedi Masters that have all of their own special powers. My favorite character was Plo Koon.
              Some of his powers involved shooting an energy blast from his hand, using the force as a bubble to block incoming shots
              from blasters, and a force push that pushed everything away around him. Its not a very long game, there are only ten levels
              to the game and a few bonus levels that you have to unlock. The combo system is easy but extremely satisfying, taking Some
              of the moves right out of the movie. I beat this game into the ground as a kid! Unlocking everything I could, getting 
              every combo I could! Till this day there has not been a Star Wars game that pulled me in like this one.

          <big>Review:</big> <br> The Call of Duty franchise is what got me into online competitive gaming. MW2 was my favorite of the series.
          The customization of weapons, titles and badges seemed endless at the time. The amount of work you had to put in to unlock these
          items were addicting. Jumping on with friends to take on other teams was a rush. Gettiing killstreaks was such a satisfying pay off 
          on top of just owning the other team. I've spent many of moons honing my skills on the games to get the unlock and i know for a fact
          that I never completely unlocked everything. The amount of weapons on this game was amazing. I was an annoying camper and when that
          didnt work Noobtubing was the way. Noobtubing is actually why this is my favorite C.O.D, it was so annoying and OP but they never got
          rid of it. The amount of rage it would put in people made it all the better. the Fan Mail I would get from this game was never disappointing.

          <big>Review:</big> <br> BattleField 4 was my way out of Call Of duty. It plays at a much slower pace. On top of that
          you can drive around in vehicles like tanks, jeeps, boats and fly in aircrafts. The maps are also huge! It really
          to sniping to another level. The bullet drop was a game changer that took time to adjust to. The classes were 
          set up completely diffent but it worked out once you took the time to understand them. Ive spent man moons trying
          to rank up in this game and rarely ever became bored with the game. You also had full customization over your player badges
          which led to some unique designs. For the weapons it was simialr to COD as in the weapon add ons and skins. Being able to
          control so many vehicles and aircrafts is what really stuck out about this game. It took ours to get everyone of them Down
          making it very challenging but rewarding. Would definetly pick Battlefield over COD any day.

          <big>Review:</big> <br> The Devil May Cry series will always be amazing to me. Playing as a demon that kills other demons!!!
          I mean come on!! Fighting with Style is how you get the max score and most fun out of it. There are a variety of weapons 
          that add to his stylish fighting. From a sword, to nunchucks, to gauntlets, you woulld have to cycle through these weapons 
          to kill your enemy. Every game in the series is fun and addicting. The more the series continued the bigger and harder 
          the enemy would become. In your fight to keep you hell from taking over you learn that our main character has family ties 
          to the Devil himself. Going through your journey discovering hidden mini games and weapons to add to your arsenal, Playing
          rarely became boring. At a certain point in the game you gain your devil trigger ability, Which turns you into an over powered 
          flying demon. The graphics to the cinematics were always so beautiful and progressive. It's a little hard to get the fighting 
          style down in the beginning but learning how to mix up your weapons and gun along with your devil trigger you learn how to tear 
          through the enemies and bosses.

          <big>Review:</big> <br> I miss Guitar Hero so much!!! I wish I could be playing this game today! The more this series
          grew the more diverse their songs became. I remember spending hour trying to get the speed and technique down so 
          I could unlocks songs and move onto higher difficulties. I eventually worked up to expert+ but geez it took a lot
          of time. Eventually they added a drumset and a mic, finally completing the band. That drumset was so fun and brought
          a diffetent perspective to the game. Guitar Hero would be the highlight of some hamg outs and it ever failed. There 
          was even ways to take some songs out and add any song you would like. I miss this game so much, I miss blasting my 
          tv full volume playing the same songs over and over so i can get down to almost perfection. They added co-op modes 
          and competitive modes with online playing which was decent but not the best. If you're a music lover but do not 
          quite have what it takes to be a musician, this game is a good middle to that, even on easy mode you can feel like
          a rock star.

          <big>Review:</big> <br> Bloody Roar, I think, will alwasy be my favorite fighter game. Having a fighter game where
          your character can change into a beast just takes the cake. There was nothing else like it, as the series went 
          on they added specials to the charaacters which made the game even better. The combos were beautiful and if you 
          knew how you could chain them into your beast mode which could lead into your specials. Tiger biting heads,
          wolves biting thoats, and an overgrow mole stabbing through people was intense!! Sadly there really isn't much else 
          to say about the game. It had an arcade style to it, so there really wasn't a story mode to it. You would get a 
          cinematic for each character after beating the arcade mode. They had cheats in the game that would make the walls 
          disappear or the hand and or heads really big. After an hour, unless you were playing with friends, it would feel
          kind of repetitive after awhile. This one was highly nostalgia driven but I recommend watching the video that is 
          provided.

         <big>Review:</big> <br> Metal Gear is game that still continues to grow through the consoles. The last addition to the series 
         was not the best but what do you expect after losing Hideo Kojima. This game is all about Tactical Espionage, stealth kills 
         was key!! If you didn't have a silencer then you could knock them out with punches or a sleeper hold. The variety of guns 
         that the game had to offer grew with each game. They would add thing to each game so it would get you to play it over and ever 
         again. Adding easter eggs everywhere. Some of the challenges were collection dog tags from almost every character or boss in the 
         game. Changing difficulties would change the amount of soldiers so if you couldnt get the hardest modes you werent going to able 
         to get all of the dog tags, thats for Metal Gear Solid 2. In MGS3 they had a similar approach but you would take bosses clothes 
         that came with a special ability. It continues like this and expands to more challenges making repeating this game so many times 
         not a problem. The cinematics were always filled with drama and action, some were a little to long tho. In one of the games a 
         cutscene took an hour to complete. I wasn't to fond of it but it was actually very important. If you into being a stealth 
         assassin them you would enjoy this game. You can also go loud with your guns but you were ALWAYS outnummbered so it mad it a lot
         harder to try and progress, in no way is this like COD.

          <big>Review:</big> <br> The Last of Us is another stealth driven game. Stealth being key to survival, not just to survive humanity
          attacks but also the infected(zombies). The Story to this game was so good that they're making an HBO series to it. You feel 
          the emotions of these characters from what they deal with. This was the first game I platinumed on PSN, I played it over and 
          over and over on every difficulty. I'm still not tired of the storyline, this game really just kicks you in the feels from beginning 
          to end. The online play for it is still extremely good for how old this game is. Its slow paced and tactical, you start off with 
          a lot less ammo then most games. With that as a factor you really are forced to think about the decisions you make. If you are 
          shooting at everything and hitting nothing then you will die without a doubt. Taking it slow and being smart about your ammo and weapons 
          is the key to being successful. There are so many jump scares on this game because you become so focused on trying to be stealthy.
          Its always fun watching and or hearing someone get scared on this game. This game is a must play, if not for online play just play 
          the story mode, it is worth it!!!!

          <big>Review:</big> <br> Rocket League is so hard!!! The mechanics on this game is insane!! Using a car to play soccer sounds
          kind of weird but it's so fun!!! The cars can fly as well!! Adding to the difficulty of this game. It is a rough start 
          in the beginning but with practice you kind of get a feel for what should and should not be done. The customization to 
          this game is insane!! So many things to choose from cars, skins, rims, boosts, trails, goals, toppers, antennas, music theme,
          and engine sounds. Theres just so much to choose from, so much!!! Hundreds and hundreds of items to choose from to put on your car.
          They usually have themed events for like christman and halloween, tournaments, giveaways, and also for the cars they will bring in 
          things from movies, tv shows and other games. You can get different versioons of the BatMobile, the Dolorian, cars from fast and 
          the furious, sweet tooths ice cream truck from twisted metal, and so much more. there just so much customization to this game to 
          make your car really feel like its just your car. I would play this game every day to get the daily challenges and season challenges
          done. The skill level for this game is so high it's ridiculous. This game does not disappoint but it can be very frustrating.
          The amount of work they are constantly putting in the game has earned its spot as number 2 in the list.

         <big>Review:</big> <br> I hate this game so much!!!! Ughhh and I love it at the same time. i have never uninstalled and reinstalled a 
         game so much in my life!!! It's such a toxic game its unbelievable. The creators add on to it on purpose!! They have emotes where 
         you literally through salt at your oppenent. They have excutions that beat people to death and top it off with spitting on them. 
         This game is cancer in video game form. As much as I hate it I dont think I can ever stop playing it. The skill level on this game
         is high and hard to attain. Once your good enought to hang in there you would never want to give that up. The game play and graphics
         of this game is like no other, seriously there is no other game like this on the market right now. Once you find your main you have 
         to level him or her up to get better looking armor. The character customization is badass and beautiful, you can also switch out your 
         emotes and excutions which are all so brutal. They hold events for most holidays so you can get exclusive gear and or emotes. My 
         favorite thing they added was lightsaber type weapons for may 4th. This game is so hard but so worth it. Every single character is 
         different and has their own skillset making adapting to each and every character hard and frustrating. For most people its more 
         satisfying to watch than actually play. I have such a love/hate relationship with this game but I know I'll never stop playing it.
         I've been playing this game for about 6 years, I played the closed beta the 365 day before the game actually released and I plan 
         on playing it until its very last day.
